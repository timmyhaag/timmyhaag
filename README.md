Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a recent Northern Kentucky University graduate with a special interest in front-end development, seeking an entry-level software or web development position in the Louisville area. Looking to decompose complex problems and create efficient solutions. I exhibit a growth mindset, and am eager to learn and adapt to different environments. I look forward to connecting with you!
